# Wildberries 🛍️ 💜

Hello and welcome! 👋

When it comes to learning, nothing beats hands-on practice. That's why I love working on projects. This time, I've taken on a cool challenge: building an e-commerce app to improve my front-end skills. 💼

I decided to clone Wildberries, a major online store in Russia that is similar to Amazon 🛍️.  Through this project, I'm not just getting better at coding, but I'm also getting a feel for how real apps are made. 🛠️

## Technologies Used 🛠️🚀

To make this happen, I used some fancy tools:

- TypeScript (TS): It helped me write better code and kept things organized. 📝
- React: I used React to craft a fast and efficient SPA. 🌐
- Redux & Redux-Toolkit: These tools handled the tricky part of managing how the app's data changed. It was like magic for keeping everything working smoothly. 🧙‍♂️
- DummyJson: This cool thing made fake product info so I could test stuff just like it was real. 🛒
- SCSS: It was like giving the app a makeover. I used SCSS to make everything look awesome. 💅


You can see how things look in the project snapshots below. 
Plus, I've put the project on Netlify. Just click the <a href="https://moonlit-kringle-f067ed.netlify.app">LINK</a> to check it out yourself. 🌐

If you've got ideas or want to help, I'm all ears! Your contributions can make the project even better. 
Thanks for stopping by and checking out what I've been working on. Happy coding! 🚀👩‍💻
